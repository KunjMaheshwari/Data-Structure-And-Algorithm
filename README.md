A "Data Structure" is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. 
Some examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, and queues.

An "Algorithm" is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. 
When it comes to data structures, algorithms are used to manipulate and organize the data within them. 
Some examples of algorithms that can be applied to data structures include searching (linear search and binary search), sorting (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort), and traversal (depth-first search, breadth-first search).
