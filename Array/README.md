Array - Array is the list of elements of the same type stored in a contiguous memory location. 

Space Complexity - Space Complexity is representated as a function that shows the amount of space necessary for an algorithm to run until complete. 
This typically mean, how much memory does the processor and data structure in our codebase take up to achieve their goal. 

Time complexity is represented as a function that shows the amount of time necessary for an algorithm to run completely. 
Worst case time complexity - The absolute most number of times an operations needs to be done before completed.
Average case time complexity - The average number of times it will take for an algorithm/code to complete. 
Amortized Running time - Similar to average, the number of times the operation will take when run a sufficient amount of time consecutively.
Best case time complexity - The fastest number of times an operation needs to complete. 
NOTE - Time and Space Complexity is not the acutal time required for an algorithm to run completely. It is the number of times a statement executes.
